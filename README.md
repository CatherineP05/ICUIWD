# HTML Beginner Project

This is my first web development project for ICUIWD.

I used HTML to create a basic website with a heading, paragraph, and examples from topics like:

- HTML Colors
- HTML Comments
- HTML Quotations

I created this using Visual Studio Code and pushed it to GitHub.
